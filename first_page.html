    <h1>The Buy & Sell system</h1>
    <p>Dealers spend most of their time on social media platforms to find accounts, their customers want.
         Dealers check almost more than 20 gaming groups to find the account their customers want and sometimes
         they are not even sure whether their customers are serious buyers or not.</p>
    <p>Customer doesn't always get the account they want.
         Same as if dealers have a gaming account, they post the video, details of the account, and price in more than 200 gaming groups
          and upload stories too, which takes a lot of time.</p>
